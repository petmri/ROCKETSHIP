function [CBF,CBV,MTT] = DSC_convolution_sSVD(concentration_array, AIF,deltaT,Kh,rho,Psvd,method,image_path) 

% The functioin DSC_CONVOLUTION is used to to calculate the residual function, R(t), and scaling factor, F,
%to be used in subsequent blood
% flow calculations.  This function uses a block circulant deconvolution
% method to solve for the residual function algebraically.  

% FUNCTION OUTPUTS: 

%   CBF: Cerebral blood flow in units of ml/100g/min. Computed for every voxel. 

%   CBV: Cerebral blood volume. 

%   MTT: Mean transit time of tracer. 

% FUNCTION INPUTS: 

%   CONCENTRATION_ARRAY: The array of concentration values. These are C(t)
%   values that are used to compute the residual. 

%   AIF: Is the arterial input function. It is concentration values of
%   arterials. This tells use how much contrast agent in flowing into the
%   tissue region.  

%   DeltaT: The time steps between scan points. We are essentially performing
%   a numerical integration to calculate cerebral blood flow and cerebral
%   blood volume. 

%   Kh: A constant ratio of capillary to artery hematocrit

%   RHO: Average tissue density.  (Its very close to unity and should
%   remain there unless you know what you're doing. 

%   Psvd: A threshold value that determines which elements to remove from
%   the SVD matrices. Values that are very low can skew computations in a
%   bad way.  

%   method: 1 calculates CBV as CBV= 100*(Kh/rho) * (c_int / AIF_int)
%   2 calculates CBV as CBV= 100*(Kh/rho) .* (integral of the residual fxn over the course of the scan)

 % We are also concerned with the CBV. To calculate the CBV we need to
 % integrate the AIF: 
 
 % Defining a time vector to integrate according to: 
 time_vect = 0 : deltaT : (dimt-1)*deltaT; 
 time_vect = time_vect'; 
 AIF_int = trapz(time_vect,AIF);

 %% Triangularize A and Account for Discretization Errors
 % We need AIF to be in the form of a lower trianguar matrix, A, in order
 % to perform our subsequent singular value decomposition. Also, we prefilter A and account for discretization errors. 
 % This is performed below.
 %In other words, traditional algebraic deconvoluiton assumes a stable AIF
 %input between measurments 
 %As described in Ostergaard et. al, 1996 this asssumption is highly innaccurate 
 %for MRI of intravascular bolus passages with low MTTs, so the AIF data
 %must be prefiltered, such that the AIF input funciton will behave as if
 %it were linear between time points. The follow section of code
 %accomplishes this. The mathamatical bases behind this is more throughly
 %explained in Ostergaard on page 718.
